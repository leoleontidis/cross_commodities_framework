# Cross-Commodities Portfolio Research Framework

<i>"A volatility-aware, subbook-balanced, mean-reverting spread trading system using dynamic z-score and rolling hedge ratios with risk monitoring, trade logging and capital tracking."</i>

This framework is a mean-reversion pair trading strategy based on z-score divergence between pairs of related commodities. It allows you to research and backtest dynamic, multi-sub-book commodity portfolios (oil, gas, grains, etc.) using futures. It supports sub-book risk control and modularity, dynamic asset selection, strategy backtesting, and risk/concentration analysis.

## Core Logic
1. Spread Trading Logic
    - Trades pairs of instruments (e.g., CL-NG, ZC-ZW) based on spread divergence from historical mean
    - Uses z-score of log-spread as the signal driver
2. Mean Reversion Hypothesis
    - Assumes that the spread between two related assets oscillates around a statistical mean
    - Entries occur at z-score ¬±Z_entry, exits at z-score approaching zero or Z_exit
3. Rolling Beta Hedge
    - Dynamically estimates hedge ratio (beta) using rolling linear regression
    - Accounts for changing correlation strength over time

4. Volatility Filter
    - Skips trades if the spread volatility exceeds a maximum threshold
    - Prevents entering trades in structurally unstable or noisy periods

5. Risk Management by Subbooks
    - Each subbook (e.g., oil, grains, gas) has its own starting capital
    - Positions and risk are calculated relative to the subbook‚Äôs current capital

6. Position Sizing Logic
    - Position size is proportional to:
        - 2% of current subbook capital
        - Adjusted by spread volatility (volatility-aware sizing)
    - Caps max position size for safety

7. Stop-Loss and Holding Time Limits
    - Hard stop-loss based on a multiple of spread volatility (default 3x).
    - Maximum holding period constraint to force exit if the spread doesn‚Äôt revert within a reasonable time frame.

8. Flexible Pair Selection
    - Supports:
        - Intra-subbook pairs (e.g., grains-grains).
        - Cross-subbook pairs (e.g., oil-grains).
        - Or all pairs.
    - Excludes pairs dynamically via config (excluded_pairs list).

9. Multi-Timeframe Support
    - Works with daily or 5-minute data (or other intervals) via data_interval config.

10. Full Backtest Transparency
    - Logs:
        - Spread history
        - Z-score evolution
        - Entry/exit points
        - PnL per pair and subbook
    - Each run produces a timestamped result folder with complete reports.

<b>Example:  </b><br>
<i>If the spread between CL and QM spikes (z > 1.5):
The strategy shorts CL and longs QM.
When spread reverts (z ‚âà 0), it exits and logs the trade.</i>
